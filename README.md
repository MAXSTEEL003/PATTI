Patti Note Calculator

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use Live Server). The left side contains inputs; the right side shows a preview matching your provided note layout. Use "Export PNG" to download the filled note as an image or "Copy Image" to copy it to the clipboard (browser support required).

Notes:
- Date input will format using your browser locale.
- If "Copy Image" fails, use Export PNG and then copy the downloaded file.
- The export uses an SVG foreignObject technique; some complex CSS may not render in older browsers. Use Chrome/Edge for best results.
